    "prompt": "You are an expert Android UI analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided screenshot and generate a clear, concise text description of the UI elements present. Then, based on the task goal, you should suggest a plan or sequence of high-level actions an automated agent could take to achieve that goal. Be specific about UI elements identified (e.g., 'Click button with text X', 'Tap icon Y', 'Input text Z').\nSpecific focus: Identify buttons, text fields, and icons clearly.\nNow, for the current screen, given the task: Click the 'Add New Item' button., describe the UI and suggest the next actions.",
    "response": "Current UI Description and Suggested Actions:\nThe screenshot provided displays a solid, uniformly blue screen.  No discernible UI elements like buttons, text fields, or icons are present.\n\nGiven the task \"Click the 'Add New Item' button,\" and the lack of such a button in the current view, it's impossible for an automated agent to complete the task in the current state.  Further information about the application or context is needed.  Possible scenarios and next actions for an agent include:\n\n* **Off-screen Button:** The button might be off-screen, requiring scrolling.  The agent should attempt to scroll down, up, left, or right to reveal more of the UI and potentially locate the button.\n* **Hidden Button:** The button might be hidden behind a menu or require a prior interaction.  The agent could explore potential menu icons (if any appear after scrolling), or look for other interactive elements that might reveal the \"Add New Item\" button.\n* **Loading State:** The blue screen might represent a loading state. The agent should wait for a predefined timeout period for the UI to fully load, then re-evaluate the screen for the presence of the button.\n* **Application Error:** The blue screen could indicate an application error.  The agent should log this as an issue and potentially attempt to restart the application.\n\nWithout more context, the agent cannot directly achieve the given task.\n\n\nTask Goal: Click the 'Add New Item' button.\n\nBased on the above, provide the optimal action as before:"

    "response": "Current UI Description and Suggested Actions:\nThe screenshot provided is a solid red image.  There are no discernible UI elements present.\n\nSince there are no UI elements visible, it's impossible to suggest specific actions to navigate to the settings menu and then display options.  Standard Android navigation paradigms cannot be assumed.\n\nThe automated agent needs more information or a different screenshot to proceed.  Possible next steps for troubleshooting:\n\n1. **Verify Screenshot Capture:** Ensure the screenshot capturing mechanism is functioning correctly and capturing the intended UI. It's possible the capture process failed.\n\n2. **Check Application State:** Determine if the application is in a loading state, displaying a splash screen, or encountering an error.  If the application is still loading, wait and capture another screenshot.\n\n3. **Device/Emulator Status:** Verify the device or emulator is functioning correctly and not in a locked or error state.\n\n4. **Contextual Information:** Obtain more information about the application being tested, the expected UI, and the steps leading up to this screenshot.  This information can help identify potential issues.\n\n\nTask Goal: Open the settings menu and navigate to display options.\n\nBased on the above, provide the optimal action as before:"
