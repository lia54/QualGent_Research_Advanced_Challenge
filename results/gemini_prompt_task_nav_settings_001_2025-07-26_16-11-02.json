The automated agent needs more context.  This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. **The app is in an unexpected state:** The red screen might indicate an error or a loading screen that hasn't completed. The agent should wait a short period and re-assess the UI.  If the red screen persists, it should report an error.\n\n2. **The screenshot is incomplete or incorrect:** The provided image might not accurately represent the device's screen.
